## Introduction / Business Problem
#### What are the factors that will influence the severity of a car accident? The weather? The number of people in the car? Or the locaiton and road condition? If we can find the factors that are likely to cause a severe car accident from past real reports, we can try to lower to severity in the future. If we can predict the severity of a car accident given some known condition, we can make alerts to drivers and passengers when needed. This model will greatly reduce the loss of lives and properties from car collisions.

## Data Description
#### The dataset including all types of collisions happened in Seattle from 2004 to present recorded by Traffic Records of Seattle Government. There are 37 attributes in total but not all attributes will be used to build the model. The severity of a collision is recorded using a code from 0 to 3. Other attributes include location, collisiontype, date, time, weather, roadcoundition, etc. Most attributes are text but some are numbers.
